# Detecting-nanoparticles-and-calculating-chaos
In this repository a MATLAB code is provided which is used to analyse Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the synthesized silver nanowires; detect unfavourable circular or semi-circular nanoparticles among favorable nanowires and calculate the generated chaos by these unfavorable nanopartciles to compare the quality of synthesized nanowires.
