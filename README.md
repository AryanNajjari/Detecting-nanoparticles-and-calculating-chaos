# Detecting-nanoparticles-and-calculating-chaos
In this repository, a MATLAB code is provided to analyze Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of synthesized silver nanowires. The code detects unfavorable circular or semi-circular nanoparticles among the desirable nanowires and calculates the resulting chaos caused by these unwanted particles to evaluate the quality of the synthesized nanowires.
